# Object Recognition and Detection Challenge - NG PSU Innovation Hack Week

## Project Overview

This repository contains our solution for the **Object Recognition and Detection Challenge** as part of **PSU Fall 2024 Innovation Hack Week**. Our team is tasked with developing a computer vision model that can accurately identify and detect common objects in home and office environments from a curated dataset of images.

### Challenge Summary

We will build a model that focuses on detecting and recognizing the following objects:
- **People** (man, woman): including human features like hair, arms, hands, legs, and clothing.
- **Devices**: watches, tablets, screens, laptops, and computers.
- **Books**: including individual books, grouped books, bookshelves, and bookcases.
- **Furniture**: chairs, ladders, desks.
- **Camera equipment**: cameras and related equipment.
- **Vehicles**: cars, wheels, number plates, mirrors.
- **Food and Drinks**.
- **Musical instruments**: piano, keyboard, guitar, and others.
- **Buildings**: structures in the background.
- **Plants**: including trees, bushes, and flowers.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives are:
1. **Object Identification**: Accurately classify the provided images based on the objects they contain.
2. **Object Detection**: Identify and locate objects within images, labeling their bounding boxes.
3. **Efficiency**: Ensure that the model operates efficiently in terms of speed and resource usage.
